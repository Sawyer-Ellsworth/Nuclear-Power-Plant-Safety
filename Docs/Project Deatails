For this project I will be comparing 3 data sets to do something (I don't know what yet)

U.S. Nuclear Power Plant Inspection Reports = inspection_reports
List of Nuclear Materials Licensing Actions Received = materials_licensing
Waste Incidental to Reprocessing Key Documents = waste_incidental

These 3 data sets are all about nuclear power related topics 
the idea for this project so far is to look at where the safest plants operate and 
what they do different
